LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app in which you can check out where and when is the next concert of your favorite band or artist. With a songs name LIRI can; 

- Display the artist(s).
- The Album it was recorded on.
- & a preview link of the song from spotify.

LIRI also can give you information on your favorite movies such as;

- The released date.
- The IMDB rating.
- The Rotten Tomatoes rating.
